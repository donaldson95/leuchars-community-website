            <h4>About Leuchars</h4>

            <p>Leuchars is situated on the peninsula lying between the estuaries of the Rivers Forth and Tay. It has a parish church, dating from the 12th century, which is considered by many experts to be the finest Norman church in Scotland. About half a mile from the village is the 16th century Earshall Castle and 3 miles outside the village is <a href="tentsmuir.html">Tentsmuir National Nature Reserve/Kinshaldy Beach</a> which provides plenty of scope for woodland and seaside walks.</p>

            <p>There are frequent bus and train services to all parts of Fife and beyond. The railway station is a 10 minute walk from the village. There is ample car parking at a cost of &pound;1.00 per day. The local bus services connect with St Andrews and Dundee every 10 minutes Monday to Saturday and every 20 minutes on Sundays.</p>

            <p><a href='http://www.angusanddundee.co.uk/'>Dundee</a>, Scotlands 4th largest city offers Cinemas, a Leisure Centre, Ice Rink, <a href='http://www.dundeereptheatre.co.uk/'>Repertory Theatre</a> as well as shopping and places to eat.</p>

          <h4>Upcoming Events</h4>

<p>The Leuchars Station Community Centre is closed for two weeks as it is being re-painted.  The Community Council meeting will go ahead on Tuesday evening but anyone wishing to attend will have to enter the building through the side door entrance and follow the signs to the Welfare Conference Room.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>update:</strong> Due to unforeseen circumstances there will be no gardening in Junction Gardens on Sunday 8th April but it will definitely be going ahead on Sunday the 15th.  Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>

<p>Gardening season is re-starting in Junction Gardens and there will be volunteers there on Sunday 8 April and Sunday 15 April from 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock. Can you spare time to come along and help get the garden ready for summer. Even if you can only spare 30 minutes, everyone will be welcome. The Community Council are meeting with Fife Council to discuss re-siting some of the planters that are currently along Station Road, including the possibility of placing one at the entrance to the village (travelling from Dundee) which someone has very kindly offered to maintain. Villagers have come forward offering to look after some of the planters around the village and the Community Council will be in touch with them shortly, however, there are still plenty planters left for people to fill. Perhaps you would prefer to take one of our baskets that hang from the lampposts along Station Road and fill it with your choice of flowers. If you would like to help with a planter or take a basket to fill (or both), please e-mail junctiongardens@gmail.com or contact any Community Council member.</p>

          <h4>Current News</h4>


<p>Leuchars Community Council have received £100 from Fife council to replace the polytunnel at the school.  Once the weather improves the work will be done to put the new cover on and we hope the children will be able to start growing their own plants.  It is also hoped to encourage other members of the community to come along and help fill the numerous baskets we put up in the village.  We have also been awarded just under £2,000 from the Sustrans Artroots Fund to place two benches along the National Cycle Route which runs last Leuchars Station (Army) down to the church and then out along Pitlethie Road.  It is hoped, once approved by Fife Council, that one bench will be placed at the bottom of Pitlethie Road, opposite the church where people can stop, take a break and admire the building with the other bench being placed outside the school.</p>

<p>The children at the school are working on a Shoe Share Project, a United Nations initiative to help fund education in countries where children are not getting an education.  If you have unwanted shoes/boots around put an elastic band round them and take them to the school or place them in the box provided in the Community Centre.  If you would like further information about this project please go to <a href="https://www.unicef.org.uk/rights-respecting-schools/resources/shoeshare/">https://www.unicef.org.uk/rights-respecting-schools/resources/shoeshare/</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone in the village would like a free Fire Safety Inspection in their home please contact Chris at Tayport Fire Station on 07380810286.</p>
