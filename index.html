          <h4>Local News</h4>


          <br /><p>Leuchars village is raising funds for a Christmas tree and lights for the festive season. A big thank you goes to St Andrews Links Community Trust who have kindly given us £3,500 towards this. People around the village are coming up with ways to fundraise and to date we have raised over £1,200. Our next event is a Tombola at the bonfire night at Earshall sports pitches and if anyone has anything they would like to donate to this they can contact the Community Council at <a href="mailto:leucharscommunitycouncil@gmail.com">leucharscommunitycouncil@gmail.com</a> and a box is also available in the Spar.</p>
          <br /><p>Junction Gardens, the village community garden, is looking good with a number of volunteers from the village spending time clearing it and the Community Payback team helping to keep it tidy. There are plans to plant 70,000 Flanders Field poppies there, in commemoration of the end of World War One. If anyone is interested in helping with this or any of the tubs around the village please contact the village gardening team at <a href="mailto:junctiongardensleuchars@gmail.com">junctiongardensleuchars@gmail.com</a>.</p>
          <br /><p>Minutes of the monthly Community Council meetings are on the village website, <a href="http://www.leuchars.org.uk">http://www.leuchars.org.uk</a>. The website is currently being updated and any suggestions as what people might like to see on it will be appreciated. Shops and businesses within the Leuchars Community Council boundary can advertise for free on the website so if you are a business in the area and you are not featured, please get in touch through the community council e-mail.</p>



          <br /><p>A big thank you to everyone who came along on Sunday to help clear an area where we have planted 70,000 Flanders Field poppy seeds which we hope to see coming through next year to commemorate the end of World War One. Sunday 22nd Oct we will be back out at 12 noon to dig another area of the garden. A limited amount of equipment is available so if you are able to come along please bring a fork or spade and a pair of gardening gloves.<br><a href="media/201710_1.JPG"><img src="media/thumbs/201710_1.JPG"></a></p>



          <br /><p>Bin Collections Calendar</p>

          <p>Fife Council are no longer printing and delivering bin collection dates to households. To find out which day your household waste and recycling bins are collected, please go to the following website <a href="http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/bincalendar">www.fifedirect.org.uk/bincalendar</a> and enter your postcode. Not printing your bin calendar saves Fife Council money and reduces our environmental impact. You can print a bin calendar at your local library. Library staff can assist customers to access and print off a copy of your bin calendar at a charge of 25p per side of A4 printed.</p>


          <br /><p>St Athernase Church Regeneration Project</p>

          <p>A £600,000 project is underway to ensure one of Scotland’s oldest working churches stands for another century. Leuchars St Athernase Church, which has stood at its prominent location since 1150 and is a Grade A listed building, had become damp ridden and was in need of extensive repairs. Scaffolding has now been up for two months and work to repair the roof, mend stonework using traditional materials and improve drainage is expected to finish this winter. The Leuchars St Athernase Regeneration Project Team secured a maximum grant of £250,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards the work.</p>
