<p>Leuchars Community Council have received £100 from Fife council to replace the polytunnel at the school.  Once the weather improves the work will be done to put the new cover on and we hope the children will be able to start growing their own plants.  It is also hoped to encourage other members of the community to come along and help fill the numerous baskets we put up in the village.  We have also been awarded just under £2,000 from the Sustrans Artroots Fund to place two benches along the National Cycle Route which runs last Leuchars Station (Army) down to the church and then out along Pitlethie Road.  It is hoped, once approved by Fife Council, that one bench will be placed at the bottom of Pitlethie Road, opposite the church where people can stop, take a break and admire the building with the other bench being placed outside the school.</p>

<p>The children at the school are working on a Shoe Share Project, a United Nations initiative to help fund education in countries where children are not getting an education.  If you have unwanted shoes/boots around put an elastic band round them and take them to the school or place them in the box provided in the Community Centre.  If you would like further information about this project please go to <a href="https://www.unicef.org.uk/rights-respecting-schools/resources/shoeshare/">https://www.unicef.org.uk/rights-respecting-schools/resources/shoeshare/</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone in the village would like a free Fire Safety Inspection in their home please contact Chris at Tayport Fire Station on 07380810286.</p>





<p>Easter Hunt on Sunday 1 April at the Leuchars Station Community Centre</p>

<p><a href="media/2018-easter-hunt-large.jpg"><img src="media/2018-easter-hunt-medium.jpg"></a></p>



<p>Mrs Trish Graham resigned as a member of Leuchars Community Council at our meeting on Tuesday 6 February.  She has served as Secretary on the Community Council for over ten years and Cllrs Tim Brett and Bill Connor presented her with a Long Service Certificate on behalf of Fife Council.  As she is moving away from the area to be closer to family, the Community Council presented her with a photograph frame containing a number of photographs of the village and the surrounding area.  We would like to thank her for her hard work and the support she has given to the local community and wish her well for the future.</p>

<p><a href="media/2018-02-DSCF1822.JPG"><img src="media/2018-02-DSCF1822-300.JPG"></a></p>

<p>Do you know there is a Public Access Defibrillator (PAD) outside Leuchars Surgery?  Would you know how to use one in an emergency?  Training can be arranged in the village for anyone who is interested in learning Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  Contact the Community Council for further information.</p>

<p>You may have noticed the grit bins have been removed from most of the areas around the village.  The one that was beside the phone box at the bottom of School Hill has been requested to be put back but if there is an area that you think needs one please get in touch with the Community Council or Fife Council.</p>

<p>Leuchars Primary School are hoping to get involved with Bikeability which teaches children how to ride their bikes on public roads and are seeking volunteers to help with this scheme.  Training will be provided and anyone who may be interested can contact the Community Council or Mrs Lucy Jess, the Head teacher at the school.  They would also like to hear from anyone who may be interested in going into the school as a volunteer.</p>

<p>The external work to St Athernase Church has been completed and a grant has been given to the Church to repair and redecorate the interior.  It is anticipated that the first service back in the church will be on Sunday 11 March.</p>

<p>This year sees the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One and the Community Council have received funding to have two bespoke commemorative benches made for the village.  It is hoped the benches will be ready by the end of May and we are asking villagers to tell us where they would like them positioned; they can be placed anywhere in the village either together or separately.  Please contact us with your suggestions.</p>

<p>The Community Council are continuing to seek new members and now require a new Secretary.  If you are interested in joining us please get in touch or come along to our next meeting.</p>

<p>Community Council meetings take place on the first Tuesday of the month at 7.00pm in the Leuchars Station Community Centre, Tutor Road and dates for the next three months are 6 March, 3 April and 1 May.</p>

<p>Adopt a planter.  There are a number of planters around the village and we have had several villagers volunteering to look after them.  We are also interested to hear from you as to whether the planters are in the right places or would like to see them elsewhere around the village.  Please e-mail junctiongardensleuchars@gmail.com or contact a member of the Community Council.</p>





          <br /><p>Leuchars village is raising funds for a Christmas tree and lights for the festive season. A big thank you goes to St Andrews Links Community Trust who have kindly given us £3,500 towards this. People around the village are coming up with ways to fundraise and to date we have raised over £1,200. Our next event is a Tombola at the bonfire night at Earshall sports pitches and if anyone has anything they would like to donate to this they can contact the Community Council at <a href="mailto:leucharscommunitycouncil@gmail.com">leucharscommunitycouncil@gmail.com</a> and a box is also available in the Spar.</p>
          <br /><p>Junction Gardens, the village community garden, is looking good with a number of volunteers from the village spending time clearing it and the Community Payback team helping to keep it tidy. There are plans to plant 70,000 Flanders Field poppies there, in commemoration of the end of World War One. If anyone is interested in helping with this or any of the tubs around the village please contact the village gardening team at <a href="mailto:junctiongardensleuchars@gmail.com">junctiongardensleuchars@gmail.com</a>.</p>
          <br /><p>Minutes of the monthly Community Council meetings are on the village website, <a href="http://www.leuchars.org.uk">http://www.leuchars.org.uk</a>. The website is currently being updated and any suggestions as what people might like to see on it will be appreciated. Shops and businesses within the Leuchars Community Council boundary can advertise for free on the website so if you are a business in the area and you are not featured, please get in touch through the community council e-mail.</p>


          <br /><p>A big thank you to everyone who came along on Sunday to help clear an area where we have planted 70,000 Flanders Field poppy seeds which we hope to see coming through next year to commemorate the end of World War One. Sunday 22nd Oct we will be back out at 12 noon to dig another area of the garden. A limited amount of equipment is available so if you are able to come along please bring a fork or spade and a pair of gardening gloves.<br><a href="media/201710_1.JPG"><img src="media/thumbs/201710_1.JPG"></a></p>


          <br /><p>Bin Collections Calendar</p>

          <p>Fife Council are no longer printing and delivering bin collection dates to households. To find out which day your household waste and recycling bins are collected, please go to the following website <a href="http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/bincalendar">www.fifedirect.org.uk/bincalendar</a> and enter your postcode. Not printing your bin calendar saves Fife Council money and reduces our environmental impact. You can print a bin calendar at your local library. Library staff can assist customers to access and print off a copy of your bin calendar at a charge of 25p per side of A4 printed.</p>


          <br /><p>St Athernase Church Regeneration Project</p>

          <p>A £600,000 project is underway to ensure one of Scotland’s oldest working churches stands for another century. Leuchars St Athernase Church, which has stood at its prominent location since 1150 and is a Grade A listed building, had become damp ridden and was in need of extensive repairs. Scaffolding has now been up for two months and work to repair the roof, mend stonework using traditional materials and improve drainage is expected to finish this winter. The Leuchars St Athernase Regeneration Project Team secured a maximum grant of £250,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards the work.</p>


          <br/><p>Blast from the past.  2011 the year Junction Gardens became a beautiful entrance to the village of Leuchars.  A lot of hard work by a number of people to get Junction Gardens to the lovely area it is today.</p>

          <br/><p>REME March to mark 75th Anniversary</p>

          <p>Hundreds of spectators lined the streets of St Andrews on Saturday 23 Sept for a special day of celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the Corps of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) based at Leuchars Station.</p>

          <p>Special guest was Major General Mitchell MBE, who took the salute during the colourful parade, which marked two years since 2 Close Support Battalion REME moved from Fallingbostel in Germany to Leuchars.</p>



          <br /><p>Leuchars Ministry of Defence Houses</p>

          <br /><p>Surplus housing at Leuchars Station is to be rented out to the public, as the MoD looks to make the most of its empty properties. A number of homes are not currently in use due to the smaller number of personnel currently working at the base. The properties are being privately let on a short-term basis meaning the housing could be made available for armed forces personnel if more were to be stationed at Leuchars in the future.</p>


          <br /><p>A long-time servant to the Community Council in Leuchars has been presented with a certificate to commemorate her sterling work over the years.  Carroll Finnie was a member of the Community Council for nearly 16 years and was chairwoman for much of that time before she recently stepped down.</p>

          </p>


          <br /><p>The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Scots DG), based at Leuchars are to be deployed to Cyprus as part of a UN peacekeeping force.  The deployment will run from October to April and their task will be to maintain peace and stability in a 180km buffer zone between the Turkish and Greek areas.</p>
