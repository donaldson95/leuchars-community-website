          <br/><p>REME March to mark 75th Anniversary</p>

          <p>Hundreds of spectators lined the streets of St Andrews on Saturday 23 Sept for a special day of celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the Corps of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) based at Leuchars Station.</p>

          <p>Special guest was Major General Mitchell MBE, who took the salute during the colourful parade, which marked two years since 2 Close Support Battalion REME moved from Fallingbostel in Germany to Leuchars.</p>



          <br /><p>Leuchars Ministry of Defence Houses</p>

          <br /><p>Surplus housing at Leuchars Station is to be rented out to the public, as the MoD looks to make the most of its empty properties. A number of homes are not currently in use due to the smaller number of personnel currently working at the base. The properties are being privately let on a short-term basis meaning the housing could be made available for armed forces personnel if more were to be stationed at Leuchars in the future.</p>


          <br /><p>A long-time servant to the Community Council in Leuchars has been presented with a certificate to commemorate her sterling work over the years.  Carroll Finnie was a member of the Community Council for nearly 16 years and was chairwoman for much of that time before she recently stepped down.</p>

          <br /><p>The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Scots DG), based at Leuchars are to be deployed to Cyprus as part of a UN peacekeeping force.  The deployment will run from October to April and their task will be to maintain peace and stability in a 180km buffer zone between the Turkish and Greek areas.</p>
